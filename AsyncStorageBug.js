This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to access the data before it has been fully retrieved. This typically happens when you try to use the data immediately after calling AsyncStorage.getItem(). Because AsyncStorage.getItem() is asynchronous, it doesn't return the data immediately; it returns a Promise.  If you try to access the value directly, you will get undefined, causing errors further down the line. 

Example:

```javascript
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // This will log the value correctly
  // Use value here
});

console.log(AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey')); // This will log a Promise, not the value
// Using AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey') here will likely cause an error because you're trying
// to use the Promise object as a string
```
